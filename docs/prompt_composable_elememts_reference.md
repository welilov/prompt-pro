# 🗂 Prompt Composable Elements Reference

This document serves as a reference guide for the composable prompt system used in promptctl. It explains the structure, organization, and available building blocks that can be combined to construct modular, reusable, and maintainable prompts.

The goal of this system is to separate prompts into well-defined components—such as agents, roles, patterns, pattern groups, and tasks—so they can be composed, extended, and managed independently. This approach improves consistency, scalability, and clarity when designing prompts for different use cases.

## Prompt Category Structure

The `prompts/` directory contains the core components used to build prompts in promptctl, organized by category.

### Categories

```bash
prompts
├── agents
├── pattern_groups
├── patterns
├── roles
└── tasks
```

You can list **prompt composable elements** by category in several ways, such as:

```bash
promptctl list roles
promptctl list roles | grep -E 'te|utor'
```

Below is a **complete list of elements** and their features available in promptctl for building prompts, composing them, and creating new ones. **Users can extend their own local version of this list** by adding new elements as they create them.

🚨 Alternatively, users can open the corresponding **element file** to review or edit its contents, but **any changes will affect all elements associated with the modified element**.
