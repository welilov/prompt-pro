# The Iceberg Of Prompting

At first glance, prompting seems simple: ask a question, receive an answer. But what appears effortless on the surface often rests on a much deeper structure beneath it. Like an iceberg, most of the power in effective prompting is hidden from view.

The visible tip consists of straightforward requests—summaries, rewrites, quick ideas. These work well for basic tasks. Beneath the surface, however, lies structured prompting: defining roles, clarifying context, setting constraints, and shaping output formats. Deeper still is strategic prompting—reasoning guidance, iteration loops, model selection, and deliberate refinement.

Mastery is not about making prompts longer. It is about knowing how deep to go. The Iceberg of Prompting is a framework for understanding that depth—when it matters, how it works, and how to use it intentionally.

## Level 1: Surface Prompting

Simple, direct requests with minimal context. Fast and useful for basic tasks, but limited when complexity or precision increases.
